Pictureshow is a boutique, full-service production company that specializes in feature films and commercial production. Based in Maryland, they have produced movies and commercials for a diverse clientele including BBC Scotland, Marriott, Haxan Films, and the DC Board of Tourism.

Pictureshow was formed in 2012 as a banner under which for Kyle David Crosby to produce a short film for Eduardo Sanchez, creator and co-director of the Blair Witch Project, and his directing partner, Gregg Hale. The short was included in the cult-favorite horror anthology, “V/H/S:2”. That film enjoyed an exciting Sundance acquisition and has gone on to be the most celebrated film in the “V/H/S” franchise.

Pictureshow produced the short film “The Confidential Informant” directed by Stephen Kinigopoulos and written by acclaimed writer and producer, George Pelecanos. The project was filmed entirely in DC and had a successful festival run garnering national acclaim. Out of its success, Pictureshow has partnered with George Pelecanos to develop an anthology feature incorporating “The Confidential Informant” as well as other original stories by Pelecanos. Production is slated to begin in 2017. Pictureshow is currently in Post Production on the independent feature “Fishbowl” written by Stephen Kinigopoulos and directed by Stephen and Alexa Kinigopoulos, their feature film debut. It was filmed entirely in MD.

On the commercial side of things, Pictureshow is a fully insured, turn-key production company. While based in MD, they have resources nationwide and can bring your idea from concept to completion. They are a non-union company, but have the ability to produce union projects as well. Reach out for your next project, they'd love to hear your pitch and help you knock it out of the park.
