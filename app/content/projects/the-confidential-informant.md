Director: Stephen Kinigopoulos

Writer/Executive Producer: George Pelecanos

Shot over the three coldest days on record in 2015 entirely in Washington, DC. The director wanted snow, so we made a deal with the guy upstairs and got him snow. And ice. By far one of the best experiences we have had to date.
